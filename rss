            <title>Release: VM Escape Exploit for Parallels Desktop Hypervisor (Pwn2Own 2021)</title>
            <link>https://zerodayengineering.com/research/pwn2own-2021-vm-escape.html</link>
            <description>A virtual machine escape exploit will typically require kernel privileges in the guest OS. In this exploit I chose to offload the reverse-engineered toolgate protocol implementation to a Python module, while keeping my low-level kernel code minimal, just enough to implement the attack interface - a nod to the principle of least privilege in systematic software engineering, which we miss a lot in non-trivial exploit development.</description>

            <link>https://zerodayengineering.com/research/discussion-fuzzing-from-first-principles.html</link>
            <description>On September 14, 2024, I had the pleasure of participating in the Off By One Security Podcast by SANS, discussing "Fuzzing from First Principles". In this follow-up article, I’ll tackle some interesting questions and comments from the livestream chat that didn’t make it into the live Q&A due to time constraints.</description>
