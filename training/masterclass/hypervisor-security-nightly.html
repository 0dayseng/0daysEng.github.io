Now it's reported in cyber news to be actively exploited in the wild, and with this mini-training I hope not only to inspire professional vulnerability and malware researchers to dig into the less-popular attack surfaces of a hugely popular corporate hypervisor, but also to let system administrators, incident responders and self-taught computer security enthusiasts (yes, you are invited and I promise to be not too much intimidating) to know their threats at the byte level, and potentially learn to avoid similar attack scenarios early before the bug was weaponized by malicious parties. </p>

                           <p>Instructor: Alisa Esage
                           Level: advanced
                           Duration: 4 hours
                           Availability: <font style="background:blue">on-demand</font></p>

                           <p>Virtualization hardware assist technologies such as AMD-V (previously marketed under the name SVM) and Intel VT-x (VMX) were introduced in 2006, but only now they are getting some serious traction in practical implementations due to lots of legacy code that mainstream hypervisors had to deal with, plus a period of de-facto lazy testing of the technology in production. As an example, legacy non-HVT code was removed from Oracle VirtualBox only around last year, while nested virtualization support (a popular target for security bugs in this attack surface so far) for Intel CPUs was added literally a few months ago. As such, hardware assist technology and the new code that it brings about represents the cutting edge of attack surfaces in modern hypervisor implementations. </p>

                           <p>Virtualization hardware assist technology (it's implemented similarly on Intel and AMD) represents a compact hardware-based framework of new privilege separation modes and ISA extentions, designed to simplify the work of a hypervisor software developer, but not at all to make in redundant. In fact, most of the HVT-based hypervisor functionality still has to be written in higl level code, while specific details of the hypervisor implementation based on it remain at discretion of the software developer. </p>

                           <p>In this masterclass we'll look at Intel VT-x hardware assist technology as it's defined in the Intel's specifications and used in the code of some popular hypervisors, understand the threat model and attack vectors, and a deep dive into security bugs specific to hardware assist code that have been publicly disclosed so far. </p>

                           <p>Topics:
                           * A quick overview of the Intel VT-x specification.
                           * Core concepts of hardware assist: root/non-root mode, VMCS struct, VM exists, ISA extention instructions. 
                           * Inspection of hardware assist code in a popular open source hypervisor.
                           * Threat modeling, attack surfaces and attack vectors. 
                           * Known vulnerabilities in popular hypervisor implementations. 
                           </p>

                           <p>You will learn:
                           * A very clear model of how virtualization hardware assist works.
                           * How hardware assist technology is used in practice, in the open source code. 
                           * Where to look for bugs. 
                           </p>

                           <p>Prerequisites:
                           * C++.
                           * x86 assembly (not mandatory, but highly recommended).
                           * Basic concepts of memory safety and application security.
                           * Some experience with privileged CPU modes and/or OS kernels would help.
