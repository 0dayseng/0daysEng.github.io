                           <p>This series of masterclasses is specialized on essential and universal topics of vulnerability research, useful for both beginners and advanced researchers regardless of the target. We'll skip the "101" trivial basics and jump straight to emerging models, tactics and tools that can make a huge difference in your bughunting progress. In addition, we will play with certain classical and proven techniques that usually become available with many years of experience in reverse engineering and vulnerability research.</p>
                           
                           <p>All our masterclasses are practical. Interleaved with solid theoretical studies to get a strong grasp of the topic, we dig into the code, build things, and play with tools, as much as time allows.</p>
                           
                           <p>Each masterclass is essentially a "howto" on one specific topic, taught from the perspective of a highly experienced hacker, pwner and reverse engineer. Coming out of the class you are expected to easily apply the acquired skill in your specialized workflow with a lot of fun and profit. </p>
                           
                           <p>Each class is 4 hours, with 25-30% of hands on exercises or labs. </p>

                           <p>Featuring afl, WinAFL, libfuzzer, and everything else that you know and love, but was afraid to apply to something that they can't support out of the box. We'll take a look at the code, how other researchers extend public fuzzers for custom purposes and non-trivial fuzzing, and set up basic practical skills for that.</p>

                           * Motivation. When an "off the shelf" fuzzer is not enough?
                           * Anti-motivation. When your favorite fuzzer is a bad take for your goal?
                           * Basic theory of modern evolutionary fuzzing with code coverage guidance.

                           * Common mutation algorithms and open questions in research.
                           * Review of successful academic and community research projects based on modified open source fuzzers. </p>

                           * When do you modify a fuzzer, what exactly and how to do it effectively.
                           * How to mod successful public fuzzers to find bugs that they failed at.
                           * How to instrument arbitrary complex targets for fuzzing with public tools.

                           <p>Pre-requisites:
                           * C-code

                           <a name="codeql"><h6>Masterclass: Fun and games with CodeQL </h6></a>
                           <p>Livestream date: September 11th, 2021 (Saturday), 13:00-17:00 UTC. 
                           Instructor: Alisa Esage.
                           Level: beginners to advanced </p>
                           
                           <p>CodeQL is a shiny new tool to assist you with static analysis for bug hunting. Known as Semmle QL previously (Semmle was acquired by Github/Microsoft), CodeQL quickly became popular due to the power and versatility of its custom programming language that lets you query arbitrary code bases for generically defined bug patterns, and has been successfully used by many professional software security teams to find new bugs. Think grep with code semantics awareness.</p>

                           <p>While CodeQL is typically applied to the problem of bug variant analysis, nothing prevents a smart bughunter to use some creativity and build queries for totally new bug classes. Mozilla runs a dedicated CodeQL security bounty. This masterclass is designed to get you started with CodeQL in no time, with the big picture in mind. </p>

                           <a name="symbols"><h6>Masterclass: Symbolizing the unsymbolizable</h6></a>
                           <p>Livestream date: August 14th, 2021 (Saturday), 13:00-17:00 UTC. 
                           Instructor: Alisa Esage. 
                           Level: beginners to advanced </p>

                           <p>Symbolic information for binaries, or "debug symbols", typically consist of procedure names as defined in the source code, occasionally with some extra details such as global variable names, structure definitions, and function arguments. While debug symbols are more or less trivially available for open source projects, majority of proprietary software vendors do not expose it. Systems such as embedded firmware, proprietary hypervisors, basebands, and majority of "normal" proprietary software are thus presented to the reverse engineer as a huge mess of many megabytes of assembly code, hard to make sense of. </p>
                              
                           <p>In addition, a general trend nowadays is that propriatary software vendors increasingly revoke and manage access to debug symbols to complicate reverse engineering, as it was observed for example with iOS kernel a couple years ago, Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor, and VMware Workstation for Linux binaries. </p>

                           <p>In advanced reverse engineering several smart approaches may be used to solve this problem, and apply or create (at least semi-automatically, not by manual naming) some meaningful names to a reverse-engineered code base. In this masterclass we'll walk through these techniques, and apply it to some real life big software RE.
                           </p>

                           <p>We'll take a look at IntelPT: how it is defined in the specifications, how it works in practice, how do you use it outside of public fuzzer integrations, existing software drivers ecosystem for various OS's and fuzzing targets, successful use cases, known research publications, and open research areas that hold the most opportunities. Learn practical skills to apply it trivially, and see what is needed for non-trivial applications.
